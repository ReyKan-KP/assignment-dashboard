# Interactive Dashboard

## Project Description

This project is a Full Stack Development Intern Assignment focused on developing an interactive dashboard application using **Next.js**, **Recharts**, and **Supabase**. The dashboard is designed to display various metrics, support user authentication, and provide data visualization capabilities. It aims to offer a user-friendly interface while ensuring secure data management and real-time updates.

## Objective

The primary goal of this project is to create a comprehensive dashboard that meets the following requirements:

- Implement user authentication using Supabase Auth.
- Design and implement a dashboard with various widgets and charts using Recharts.
- Ensure responsive design for mobile compatibility.
- Deploy the application on Vercel.
- Provide clear documentation on setup and usage.

## Features

- **User Authentication:** Secure login and registration using Supabase.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** Real-time data updates with charts and metrics.
- **Customizable User Settings:** Personalize user profiles and preferences.
- **Data Management:** Easily manage data entries and updates through the UI.
- **Responsive Design:** Fully functional on both desktop and mobile devices.
